 This software package is based on the paper
    I. Bogaert, "Iteration-Free Computation of Gauss-Legendre Quadrature Nodes and Weights",
    to be published in the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing.
 .
 The main features of this software are:
 - Speed: due to the simple formulas and the O(1) complexity computation of individual Gauss-Legendre
   quadrature nodes and weights. This makes it compatible with parallel computing paradigms.
 - Accuracy: the error on the nodes and weights is within a few ulps (see the paper for details).
